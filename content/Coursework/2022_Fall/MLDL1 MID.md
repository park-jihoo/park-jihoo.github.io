# Statistical Learning


	## Is there an ideal $f(X)$?

		- $\mathbb{E}(Y|X=4)$ means expected value of $Y$ given $X = 4$
		- The good choice of $f(x) = \mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)$ is called the regression function

	## Regression function $f(x)$

		- Is the ideal or optimal predictor of $Y$ with regard to mean-squared prediction error: $f(x) = \mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)$ is the function that minimizes $\mathbb{E}[(Y-g(X))^2|X=x]$ over all functions $g$ at all points $X =x$
		- $\epsilon = Y-f(x)$ is the irreducible error. Even if we knew $f(x)$ we would still make erros in prediction ,since at each $X=x$ there is typically a distribution of possible
		- For any estimate of $\hat f(x)$ of $f(x)$, we have

			$$
			\begin{aligned}\mathbb{E}\left[(Y-\hat f(X))^2 | X= x \right]&=\mathbb E\left[(f(X)+\epsilon - \hat f(X))^2|X=x \right]\\&=[f(x)-\hat f(x)]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)\end{aligned}
			$$


	## How to estimate $f$

		- We will always assume that we have observed a set of $n$ different data points, which are called training data
		- Our goal is to apply learning method to the training data in order to estimate the unknown function $f$
		- Most statistical learning method for this task can be characterized as either **parametric** or **non-parametric**

### Parametric(Structured) Models

- A linear model is an important example of a parametric model, which is specified in terms of $p+1$ parameters
- Another examples: Logistic model, or etc.
- There exist a risk that the functional form used to estimate $f$ can be different from true $f$

### Non-parametric models

- Non parametric methods do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$.
- They seek in estimate of $f$ that gets close to data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly
- Non-parametric model require a very large number of observations to obtain an accurate estimate for $f$

	## Trade-offs

		- Prediction accuracy vs. interpretability
		- Goot fit vs overfit(or underfit)
		- Parsimony vs black-box

		### Model accuracy


		$$
		\text{MSE}_\text{te} = \text{Ave}_{i\in\text{te}}\left[y_i - \hat f(x_i)  \right] ^2 = \frac 1M \sum_{i\in\text{te}}\left[y_i - \hat f(x_i)  \right] ^2 
		$$

		- Compute model accuracy using fresh test data different from training data

		### Bias-Variance Tradeoff


		$$
		\mathbb{E}\left[y_0 - \hat f(x_0) \right]^2 = \text{Var}(\hat f(x_0)) + \left[\text{Bias}(\hat f(x_0)) \right]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)
		$$

		- Typically as the flexibility of $\hat f$ increases, its variance increases and its bias decreases. So choosing the flexibility based on average test error amounts to bias-variance tradeoff

	## Classification Problem

		- If $Y$ is qualitive, build a classifier $C(X)$ that assigns a class label from $C$ to future unlabeled observation $X$
		- Bayes optimal classifier at $x$ is

			$$
			C_{\text{Bayes}}(x)=j^* \text{ where  }j^* = \arg\max_{j\in C}\mathbb P(Y=j|X=x)
			$$


			and this classifier has smallest error


# Linear Regression


	## Simple Linear Regression with single predictor

		- Assume a model

			$$
			Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
			$$


			where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope.

		- Given some estimates $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ for the model coefficients, we predict ]

			$$
			\hat y = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1x
			$$

		- The residual sum of square RSS = $e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \cdots+e_n^2$
		- The least squares approach to choose $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ to minimize RSS

			$$
			\hat\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^2}\\ \hat\beta_0 = \bar y - \hat\beta_1x
			$$

		- Standard error of estimator reflects how it varies under repeated sampling

			$$
			SE(\hat\beta_1)^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^2}, SE(\hat\beta_0)^2=\sigma^2\left[ \frac1n + \frac{\bar x^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^2}\right]
			$$

		- This standard error can be used to compute confidence intervals!

	## Hypothesis Testing

		- Null hypothesis $H_0$ means there is no relationship between X and Y
		- Alternative hypothesis $H_A$ means there is some relationship between X and Y
		- In linear regression,

			$$
			H_0 : \beta_1 = 0 \text{ versus } H_A: \beta_1\not=0
			$$

		- To test null hypothesis, we compute t-statistics with $n-2$ degrees of freedom

			$$
			t = \frac{\hat\beta_1 - 0}{SE(\hat\beta_1)}
			$$

		- Residual standard error $RSE = \sqrt{\frac{RSS}{n-2}}$
		- R-squared $R^2 = 1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}$
		- Correlation $r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar x)^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar y)^2}}$

	## Multiple Linear Regression

		- Model is

			$$
			Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2X_2 +\cdots+\beta_pX_p+\epsilon
			$$

		- The ideal scenario is when the predictors are uncorrelated because correlations amongst predictors cause problems
		- We calculate RSS and $\hat\beta$ like this

			$$
			\begin{aligned}RSS &= (y-X\hat\beta)^\top(y-X\hat\beta)\\\frac{\partial RSS}{\partial\hat\beta}&=-2X^\top y + 2X^\top X\hat\beta = 0\\\hat\beta &= (X^\top X)^{-1}X^\top y\end{aligned}
			$$

		- If $X^\top X$ is not invertible, that means columns are not independent, and it’s not full rank. This means $x$s are correlated.
		- Is at least 1 predictor useful? We use F-statistic to check this

			$$
			F = \frac{(TSS-RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\sim F_{p,n-p-1}
			$$


	## Deciding on the important variables

		- Forward selection: begin with null model and fit p simple linear regression, then add to model with lowest RSS
		- Backward selection: begin with full model, and remove the variable with largest p value
		- How to choose optimal member? AIC, BIC, adjusted R-square, CV

# Classification

	- Logistic regression or discriminant analysis is more appropriate than linear regression!

	## Logistic Regression

		- Logistic regression uses the form

			$$
			p(X;\beta) = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 X}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 X}}
			$$

		- If we rearrange this, then

			$$
			\log\left(\frac{p(X;\beta)}{1-p(X;\beta)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
			$$


			and this monotone transformation is called the log odds


	## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

		- We use maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters

			$$
			\mathcal{L}(\beta) = \mathcal{L}(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \prod_{i:y_i=1}p(x_i;\beta)\prod_{j:y_j=0}(1-p(x_j;\beta))
			$$

		- This likelihood gives the probability of the observed zeros and ones in the data, and we pick $\beta$ to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.
		- Log make products to sums

			$$
			\log\mathcal{L}(\beta) = \sum_{i:y_i=1}\log p(x_i;\beta)+\sum_{j:y_j=0}\log(1-p(x_j;\beta))
			$$

		- To maximize log likelihood, set its derivatives to zero, but this doesn’t have closed form

	## Multiple Logistic Regression

		- Confounding: Outcome에 영향을 미치는 것을 포함시키지 않으면 결과가 달라질 수 있는 것을 언급함 → 해결하기 위해서 Multiple Logistic Regression 이용
		- For class $k \in \{1,...,K\}$

			$$
			\mathbb{P}(Y=k|X,\beta) = \frac{e^{\beta_{0k}+\beta_{1k}X_1+\cdots+\beta_{pk}X_p}}{\sum_{l=1}^Ke^{\beta_{0l}+\beta_{1l}X_1+\cdots+\beta_{pl}X_p}}
			$$


	## Linear Discriminant Analysis

		- Use Bayes theorem slightly differently

			$$
			\mathbb{P}(Y=k|X=x) = \frac{\pi_kf_k(x)}{\sum_{l=1}^K\pi_lf_l(x)}
			$$

		- When the classes are well separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable.

		### LDA when $p=1$

		- $p_k(x) = \mathbb P(Y=k|X=x)$, and $\delta_k(x) = \log p_k(x)$
		- $k^* = \argmax_k p_k(x) = \argmax_k\delta_k(x) = x\frac{\mu_k}{\sigma^2}-\frac{\mu_k^2}{2\sigma^2}+\log(\pi_k)$
		- Then, $\hat\mu_k = \frac 1{n_k} \sum_{i:y_i=k}x_i$, $\hat\sigma^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K\frac{n_k-1}{n-K}\hat\sigma_k^2$, $\hat\pi_k =\frac{n_k}n$

		### LDA when $p>1$

		- Density

			$$
			f(x) = \frac1{(2\pi)^{p/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}}e^{-\frac12(x-\mu)^\top\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}
			$$

		- Discriminant funciton $\delta_k(x) = x^\top\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k - \frac 12 \mu_k^\top\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k + \log\pi_k$
		- Once we have estimated $\hat\delta_k(x)$, then we can turn theses into estimates for class probabilities

			$$
			\mathbb{\hat P}(Y=k|X=x) = \frac{e^{\hat\delta_k(x)}}{\sum_{l=1}^K e^{\hat\delta_l(x)}}
			$$


	## Types of errors

		- False positive rate: The fraction of negative examples that are classified as positive
		- False negative rate: The fraction of positive examples that are classified as negative
		- In order to reduce the false negative rate, we may want to reduce threshold but it may increase the overall error rate

	## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

		- With Gaussians but different $\Sigma_k$ in each class, we get quadratic discriminant analysis
		- $\delta_k(x) = -\frac12(x-\mu_k)^\top \Sigma_k^{-1}(x-\mu_k)+\log\pi_k-\frac12\log|\Sigma_k|$

	## Naive Bayes

		- Assume features are independent in each class
		- Gaussian naive bayes assumes each $\Sigma_k$ is diagonal

			$$
			\begin{aligned}\delta_k(x) &\propto\log\left[\pi_k\prod_{j=1}^pf_{kj}(x_j)\right]\\&=-\frac12\sum_{j=1}^p\left[ \frac{(x_j-\mu_{kj})^2}{\sigma_{kj}^2}+\log\sigma^2_{kj}\right]+\log\pi_k\end{aligned}
			$$


# Cross-Validation


	## Validation-set approach

		- We randomly divide the available set of samples into two parts: training and validation(hold-out)
		- The learning method is fit on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set
		- However, validation set error may tend to overestimate the test error for the model fit on the entire data set

	## K-fold CV

		- A set of n observations is randomly split into K non-overlapping groups of observations
		- Each of these K groups acts as a validation set, and the remainder as a training set.
		- LOOCV(Leave-one out CV): A training set contains all except one, and validation set is only one observation.

			$$
			CV_{(n)} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{y_i-\hat y_i}{1-h_i}\right)^2
			$$


	## CV for classification

		- Compute

			$$
			CV_k = \sum_{k=1}^K\frac{n_k}n\text{Err}_k
			$$

		- The estimated standard deviation of $CV_K$ is

			$$
			\hat{SE}(CV_k) = \sqrt{\frac1k\sum_{k=1}^K\frac{(\text{Err}_k-CV_k)^2}{K-1}}
			$$

		- This is useful estimate but not quite valid

# Bootstrap

	- The bootstrap is a flexible and powerful statistical tool that resamples a single dataset to create many simulated samples and can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or ML method
	- For example, we want to minimize $\text{Var}(\alpha X+(1-\alpha)Y)$, and one saw $\alpha=\frac{\sigma_Y^2-\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2-2\sigma_{XY}}$
		- To estimate standard deviation of $\hat\alpha$, repeat process of simulating 100 paired observations of X and Y and estimate $\alpha$ 1000 times, then we will get $\hat\alpha_1,...\hat\alpha_{1000}$
		- The mean over all 1000 estimates for $\alpha$ is

			$$
			\bar\alpha=\frac 1{1000}\sum_{r=1}^{1000}\hat\alpha_r
			$$

		- The standard deviation of the estimate is

			$$
			\sqrt{\frac1{1000-1}\sum_{r=1}^{1000}(\hat\sigma_r-\bar\sigma)^2}
			$$

	- Each of the bootstrap data sets is created by sampling with replacement, and same size as original dataset.
	- We estimate the standard error of these bootstrap estimates using the formula

		$$
		SE_B(\hat\alpha) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1}\sum_{r=1}^B(\hat\alpha^{*r}-\bar{\hat\alpha}^*)^2}
		$$

	- Bootstrap can be used to approximate confidence interval
	- However, each bootstrap sample has significant overlap with the original data. About 2/3 of the original data points appear in each bootstrap sample

# Model Selection


	## Considerations

		- Prediction accuracy: especially when $p>n$
		- Model interpretability: by removing irrelevant features

	## Subset Selection

		- Best subset selection
			1. Let $M_0$ denote the null model, which contains no predictors. This model simply predicts the sample mean for each observations
			2. For $k=1,2,…,p$
				1. Fit all $\begin{pmatrix}p\\k\end{pmatrix}=\frac{p!}{k!(p-k!)}$ models that contain exactly $k$ predictors
				2. Pick the best among these models and call it $M_k$ Here $k$ best is defined as having the smallest RSS(or largest R-squared)
			3. Select a single best model among $M_0,…,M_p$ using cross validated prediction error, $C_p$, AIC, BIC or adjusted $R^2$
		- Stepwise selection
			- There are a lot of kinds that can happen if $p$ goes very large. It can also leads to overfitting, so suggest stepwise selection
			- Forward stepwise selection
				1. Let $M_0$ denote the null model, with no predictors
				2. For $k=0,…,p-1$
					1. Consider all $p-k$ models that augment the predictors in $M_k$ with one additional predictor
					2. Choose the best among this $p-k$ models, and call it $M_{k+1}$.
				3. Select a single best model from among $M_0,…,M_p$ using cross validated predictoin error, $C_p$, AIC, BIC, or adjusted $R^2$
			- Backward stepwise selection
				1. Let $M_p$ denote the full model, with all predictors
				2. For $k=p,p-1,…,1$
					1. Consider all $k$ models that contain all but one of the predictors in $M_k$
					2. Choose the best among this $k$ models and call it $M_{k-1}$
				3. Select a single best model from among $M_0,…,M_p$ using cross-validated prediction error, $C_p$, AIC, BIC or adjusted $R^2$

	## Estimating test error

		- Directly estimate the test error with using either a validation set or cross validation approach
		- Mallow’s $C_p = \frac1n(RSS+2d\hat\sigma^2)$
		- The $AIC = -2\log L + 2d$
		- $BIC = \frac1n(RSS+\log(n)d\hat\sigma^2)$
		- Adjusted $R^2$ = $1-\frac{RSS/(n-d-1)}{TSS/(n-1)}$ → large value indicates a model with low test error

	## Ridge Regression

		- Ridge regression coefficient estimates $\hat\beta^R$ that minimizes

			$$
			\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i-\beta_0-x_i^\top\beta\right)^2 + \lambda\|\beta\|_2^2
			$$


			with $x_i = [x_{i1},...x_{ip}]^\top\in\R^p$ and $\beta=[\beta_1,...,\beta_p]^\top\in\R^p$

		- Selecting a good value for $\lambda$ is critical, and it’s found with CV
		- It is best to apply ridge regression after standardizing the predictors, using the formula

			$$
			\tilde x_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sqrt{\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{ij}-\bar x_i)^2}}
			$$


	## LASSO


		$$
		\text{minimize}_\beta\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i-\beta_0-x_i^\top\beta \right)^2+\lambda\|\beta\|_1\right\}
		$$


		where $\lambda\ge0$ is tuning paramter and $\|\beta\|_1 = \sum_{j=1}^p|\beta_j|$

		- Lasso’s $l_1$ penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter $\lambda$ is sufficiently large
		- Like best subset selection, lasso performs variable selection

		$$
		\text{minimize}_\beta\sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i-x_i^\top\beta\right)^2\text{ subject to } \|\beta\|_1\le s
		$$

		- Lasso prefers sparse model because $\|\beta\|_1=|\beta_1|+|\beta_2|\le s$(lasso, square) and $\|\beta\|_2^2 = \beta_1^2+\beta_2^2\le s$(ridge, circle)

# Decision Trees


	## Tree-based methods

		- The set of splitting rules used to segment the predictor space can be sumamrized in a tree, these types of approaches are known as decision tree methods
		- Simple and useful for interpretation
		- Are not competitive with the best supervised learning approaches in terms of prediction accuracy

	## Tree-Building process

		1. Divide the predictor space - set of possible values for $X_1,X_2,…,X_p$ into $J$ distinct and non-overlapping region $R_1,R_2,…,R_J$
		2. For every observation that falls into the region $R_j$, we make the same predictioni, which is simply the mean of the response values for the training observations in $R_j$
		- The goal is to find $R_1,R_2,…R_J$ that minimizes the RSS

			$$
			\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{i\in R_j}(y_i-\hat y_{R_j})^2
			$$

		- This approach is top down greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting
		- In greater detail, we define the pair of half planes

			$$
			R_1(j,s) = \{X|X_j<s\}\text{ and } R_2(j,s)=\{X|X_j\ge s\}
			$$


			and minimize


			$$
			\sum_{i:x_i\in R_1(j,s)}(y_i-\hat y_{R_1})^2 + \sum_{i:x_i\in R_2(j,s)}(y_i-\hat y_{R_2})^2
			$$


	## Choosing the best tree


		### Pruning

		- A small tree with fewer splits might lead to lower variance, and larger tree an lead to overfit
		- Cost complexity pruning → introduce tuning parameter $\alpha$

			$$
			\sum_{m=1}^{|T|}\sum_{x_i\in R_m}(y_i-\hat y_{R_m})^2 + \alpha|T|
			$$

		- Similar to LASSO, and select an optimal value $\hat\alpha$ with cross-validation

	## Classification trees

		- For a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occuring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs
		- The Gini index is defined by

			$$
			G = \sum_{k=1}^K\hat p_{mk}(1-\hat p_{mk})
			$$


			is a measure of total variance across the K classes

		- An alternative to the gini index is cross-entropy, given by

			$$
			D = -\sum_{k=1}^K\hat p_{mk}\log\hat p_{mk}
			$$


# Another Tree-based methods


	## Bagging

		- Bootstrap aggregation, or bagging is a general purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a machine learning method. Averaging a set of observations reduce variance

			$$
			\hat f_{bag}(x) = \frac 1B\sum_{b=1}^B\hat f^{*^b}(x)
			$$

		- In classification tree, take majority vote
		- Remaining one-third of the observations not used to fit given bagged trees are referred to as the out of bag(OOB) distribution

	## Random Forest

		- Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a small tweak that decorrelates the trees
		- When building decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random selection of $m$ predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors. The split is allowed to use only one of those $m$ predictors

	## Boosting

		- Boosting works in similar way with bagging, except that the trees are grown sequentially: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees
		1. Set $\hat f(x_i)=0$ and $r_i=y_i$ for all $i=1,…,n$ in the training set
		2. For $b=1,2,…,B$, repeat
			1. Fit a tree $\hat f_b$ with d splits to surrogate training data $\{x_i, r_i\}_{i=1}^n$
			2. Update $\hat f$ by adding in a shrunken version of the new tree

				$$
				\hat f(x)\leftarrow\hat f(x)+\lambda \hat f_b(x)
				$$

			3. Update the residual

				$$
				r_i \leftarrow r_i-\lambda\hat f_b(x_i)
				$$

		3. Output the boosted model

			$$
			\hat f(x) = \sum_{b=1}^B \lambda\hat f_b(x)
			$$

		- The boosting approach learns slowly
		- By fitting small trees to the residuals we slowly improve $\hat f$ in areas where it doesn’t perform well. The shrinkage parameter $\lambda$ slows the process down even further
		- Parameter: number of tree $B$, shrinkage parameter $\lambda$, number of splits $d$ in each tree

# Support Vector Machine


	> 💡 We try and find a plane that separates the classes in feature space


	## Hyperplane

		- Hyperplane

			$$
			\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\cdots+\beta_pX_p = 0
			$$

		- In this hyperplane, $\beta = (\beta_1, \beta_2,...,\beta_p)$ is called the normal vector
		- If $Y_i\cdot f(X_i) > 0$ for all $i$, $f(X)=0$ defines a separating hyperplane

	## Classifier

		- Maximal margin classifier

			$$
			\begin{aligned}\text{maximize}_{\beta_0,...,\beta_p}\text{ } & M \\\text{subject to} &\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j^2 = 1,\\&y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i1}+...+\beta_px_{ip})\ge M\\&\forall i = 1,...,n\end{aligned}
			$$

		- Support vector classifier(maximizes a soft margin)

			$$
			\begin{aligned}\text{maximize}_{\beta_0,...,\beta_p}\text{ } & M \\\text{subject to} &\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j^2 = 1,\\&y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i1}+...+\beta_px_{ip})\ge M(1-\xi_i),\xi_i\ge0&\forall i = 1,...,n\\&\sum_{i=1}^n\xi_i\le C\end{aligned}
			$$

		- If C becomes larger then margin becomes wider

	## Kernels

		- Inner product $\lang x_i, x_{i'} \rang = \sum_{i=1}^px_{ij}x_{i'j}$
		- The linear support vector classifier can be represented as

			$$
			f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\lang x,x_i\rang
			$$

		- Kernel: a generalization of the inner product of the form $K(x_i, x_{i'})$ for vectors $x_i,x_{i'}\le\R^p$

			$$
			f(x) = \beta_0 +\sum_{i\in\mathcal S}\hat\alpha_i K(x, x_i)
			$$


	## Multi Class

		- OVA(one vs all): fit K different 2-class SVM classifiers $\hat f_k(x)$
		- OVO(one vs one): fit all $\begin{pmatrix}K\\2\end{pmatrix}$ pairwise classifiers $\hat f_{kl}(x)$

# Unsupervised Learning


	## PCA

		- PCA produces a low-dimensional representation of a dataset. Finds a sequence of linear combinations of the variables that have maximal variance
		- First principal component of the set is

			$$
			Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1+\phi_{21}X_2+...+\phi_{p1}X_p
			$$

		- We refers to the elements $\phi_{k1}$ as the loadings of first principal component.
		- Score: $z_{i1}=\phi_{11}\phi_{i1}+\phi_{21}\phi_{i2}+...+\phi_{p1}\phi_{ip}$
		- We want to maximize $\frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n z_{i1}^2$ → solve by SVD
		- Strength of each component is about proportion of variance explained by each one

			$$
			\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{im}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^p\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ij}^2}
			$$


	## Clustering

		- Refers to a very broad set of techniques for finding subgroups, or clusters in a data set
		- K-means clustering: seek to partition the observations into a pre-specifed number of clusters
		- Hierarchical clustering: we do not know in advance how many clusters we want.
