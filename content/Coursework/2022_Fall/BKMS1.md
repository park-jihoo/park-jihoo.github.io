# Introduction

- Data is a **collection of values** that convey information
- A data model is a collection of high-level data description
- A database(DB) is organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically
- A database management system(DBMS) is software designed to assist in maintaining and utilizing databases
- Transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a DBMS against a database
- A query is a precise request for information retrieval made to a database

## History of DBMS

- 1960s, navigational DBMS
- 1970s, RDBMS
- 1980s, focus on OLTP(On-Line Transaction Processing) → Large number of simple transactions like insert, update,
   delete
- 1990s, emergence of OLAP(On-Line Analytical Processing) → Column-based database
- 2000s, NoSQL, NewSQL, In-Memory DBMS

# Relational Model

## Data Types

- Structured data and unstructured data
    - Each data type has its own storage size per value

  ## Relational Model

    - Most widely used model
    - Relation = Table + Schema
        - Table: consists of rows and columns (linked by join)
        - Schema: specifies name of relation, each column’s name and data type
    - Relational database = a set of relations

  ## Integrity Constraints

    - Integrity Constraint: condition that must be true for any instance of the database
    - ICs maintain and assure data accuracy and consistency over its entire life cycle
    - Types of ICS
        - Entity integrity: every table must have a **PK** and this should be **unique** and **not null**
        - Referential integrity: If all foreign key constraints are enforced referential integrity is achieved
            - Foreign key: Set of columns in one table that is used to refer to a tuple in another table(which is
              primary key of another table)
        - Domain integrity: All columns in a relational database must be declared upon a defined domain

  ## Views

    - A View is just a virtual relation, but we store a definition, rather than a set of rows
- <u>Views</u> describe how users see the data
    - <u>Conceptual schema</u> defines logical structure
    - <u>Physical schema</u> defines the files and indexes used
    - Data independence
        - Logical data independence: ability to change the conceptual schema without changing external views or
          applications
        - Physical data independence: separate conceptual levels from the internal/physical levels

# Database Design

## Requirement Analysis

- Determining which data to store

  ## Logical Database Design

    - ERD
        - Entity(rectangle): object, class, person or place
        - Relationship(diamond): describe the relation between entities
        - Attribute(ellipse): describe the property of an entity or relationship

      ```mermaid
      erDiagram
          CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
          CAR {
              string registrationNumber PK
              string make
              string model
              string[] parts
          }
          PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
          PERSON {
              string driversLicense PK "The license #"
              string(99) firstName "Only 99 characters are allowed"
              string lastName
              string phone UK
              int age
          }
          NAMED-DRIVER {
              string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK
              string driverLicence PK, FK
          }
          MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes
      ```

    - Entity to table
        - Columns: attribute of entity
        - Each row represents a single entity
        - PK: key attribute
    - Relationship to table
        - Columns: attributes of the relationship + keys for each participating entity set
        - Each row represents a single entity-entity relationship
        - PK: key set from participating entity sets

  ## Database Normalization

    - Data redundancy
        - Update anomaly: same information can be expressed on multiple rows

    	- Insertion anomaly: certain facts cannot be recorded at all

    	- Deletion anomaly: deletion of data representing certain facts necessitates deletion of data representing completely different facts
    - First normal form: columns which contain sets of values or nested records are not allowed
    - Second normal form: every non-candidate-key attribute must depend on the whole candidate key
    - Third normal form: transitive FDs are not allowed

# SQL

    - Structured Query Language

    - DDL(Data definition), DML(Data manipulation), DCL(Data control)

    - DDL Example

    	```sql
    	CREATE TABLE Students(Sid int, Sname text, Gpa real);
    	CREATE TABLE Enrollment(Sid int, Cid int);
    	ALTER TABLE Enrollment
    	ADD FOREIGN KEY(Sid) REFERENCES Students(Sid);
    	DROP TABLE Students CASCADE;
    	```

    - DML Example

    	```sql
    	INSERT INTO Students VALUES (3, 'Alice', 4.0);
    	DELETE FROM Courses WHERE Cname = 'CS6320';
    	UPDATE Courses SET Cid = 7 WHERE Cname = 'CS4320';
    	SELECT Sname, Gpa FROM Students WHERE Gpa > 3.5;
    	```

# Storage

    - Computer memory hierarchy

    	- Registers

    	- CPU Cache

    	- Main Memory

    	---

    	- SSD

    	- HDD

    	- Tape Backup

    - Relevance for DBMS

    	- Capacity limits force data to lower parts of hierarchy

    	- Data access speed may become bottleneck

    	- Random data access is expensive

    	- Consider volatility for recovery consideration

    ## Data storage Format

    ### Row Store

    - Record formats - fixed length: Finding ith column doesn’t require scan of record

    - Record formats - variable length: Each row has different data size, so second format offers direct access to ith column

    - Optimized for selective updates and retrieval of full columns

    - Good for OLTP workload

    ### Column store

    - Create sorted dictionary of each columns

    - Columns from original table are encoded using sorted dictionaries

    - We don’t need to store encoded values in sorted dictionaries

    - Optimized for full scan of selection of columns

    - Good for OLAP workload

    - More compact storage

    ## In-memory Storage layout

    ### Contiguous Stoarge

    - Store table in contiguously allocated memory

    - Fast scan

    - Effective in situations where there is no change in data

    ### Paged Storage

    - Split table into multiple pages

    - Same memory size per page

    - Effective for adding and deleting tuples

# Indexing

# NoSQL DBMS

# Graph Components

    - Node(Vertex) : The Main data element from which graphs are constructed

    - Relationship(Edge) : A Link between 2 nodes

# Cypher

# Query Processing

    - Query Processing 단계

    ```mermaid

        id1(Input Query)-->id2(Query Parser);
        id2-->id3(Query Rewriter);
        id3-->id4(Logical Plan);

        id5-->id6(Physical Plan);
        id6-->id7(Query Executer);
        id7-->id8(Query Result);

    ```

    - SQL vs Relational Algebra

    	- SQL : Write **what** you want

    	- Relational Algebra: About **query plan**

    - Relational Algebra Operation

    	- Unary Operator: Projection( \pi ), Selection( \sigma ), Renaming( \rho )

    	- Binary Operator: Union( \cup ), Set-different( - ), Cross-product( \times )

    	- Compound Operators: Intersection( \cap ), Join( \Join )

    - Projection and Selection

    - Row Store: 해당하는 테이블의 자료들만 읽으면 되며, 이들은 각각의 열에서 자리가 지정되어 있기 때문에 전체 중에 이 열들만 읽으면 됨

    - Column Store: 조건이 들어가 있는 경우 그 컬럼에서 조건을 찾고, 해당하는 binary code보다 큰 값을 가진 것을 1로 하는 result bit vector을 만들어 해결

# Join

    - Operators

    - One of the most expensive operations

    - However some are more generic, faster and uses small memory

    - Simple Nested Loops Join : 하나하나 하는 것 Cost는 O(MN)

    	```python
    	for e in rows(E):
    	    for s in rows(S):
    	        if(e.sid==s.sid):
    	            add_result(e, s)
    	
    	```

    - Index Nested Loops Join: inner column의 index를 찾아서 조인함 Cost는 O(M \times (cost \ of \ index))

    	```python
    	for e in rows(E):
    	    s = S(s.sid = e.sid)
    	    add_result(e, s)
    	
    	```

    - Sort-Merge Join : sort한 뒤 하나하나 merge함. Cost는 O(N\log N+M\log M)

    	```python
    	sorted(S, key=S.sid)
    	sorted(E, key=E.sid)
    	s = S.first
    	e = E.first
    	while s in S and e in E:
    	    if s.sid > e.sid:
    	        e = e.next
    	    elif s.sid == e.sid:
    	        add_result(e, s)
    	        e = e.next
    	    else:
    	        s = s.next
    	
    	```

    - Hash join: inner table을 hash로 만들어서 join하는 방법

    - Join in Column store

    	- Make a dictioniary translation table

    	- list row ids of t2 with value ids of t1 by translation table

    	- list matching row ids

# Query Planning

    - Logical Query plan: specifies types of operations

    - Example

    	```mermaid
    	flowchart BT
    	id2(C.cname == 'DS5700' and S.major = 'Data science')-->id1(S.sname);
    	id3(join on e.cid = c.cid)-->id2;
    	id4(join on s.sid = e.sid)-->id3;
    	id5[(courses table)]-->id3;
    	id6[(students table)]-->id4;
    	id7[(enrollment table)]-->id4;
    	
    	```

    - Physical Query plan: specifies implementation as well

    - Example

    	```mermaid
    	flowchart BT
    	id4(sort merge join on s.sid = e.sid)-->id1(S.sname, projection);
    	id3(hash join on e.cid = c.cid)-->id4;
    	id2(S.major = 'Data science', scan filter)-->id4;
    	id9(C.cname == 'DS5700', scan filter)-->id3;
    	id5[(courses table)]-->id9;
    	id6[(students table)]-->id2;
    	id7[(enrollment table)]-->id3;
    	
    	```

    - Query Optimization : There is a Heuristic Restrictions for Query Plan

    	- Apply predicate/projection early

    	- Avoid predicate-less join

    	- Left deep plans to make max pipeline

# ACID Properties

    - Transaction : symbolizes a unit of work, performed within a DBMS

    	```plain text
    	BEGIN; -- begin a transaction
    	COMMIT; -- end a transaction
    	ROLLBACK; -- about a transaction
    	
    	```

    - Atomicity: all steps of transaction are executed **OR** none of them are executed

    - Consistency: data is consistent with all IC(PK, FK, Domain integrity). If not, abort transactions

    - Isolation: different users may execute transactions **concurrently**, so DBMS may **interleave** steps

    - Durability: DBMS guarantees that committed updates persist

# Isolation

# Concurrency Control

    - Schedule : ordered steps from multiple transactions

    - good schedules

    	- Serial(one transaction after another)

    	- Schedules **equivalent** with serial schedule

    - Final State Equivalence : Compare two schedules based on **final database state**

    - Final State Serializable: if there exists serial schedule which is final state equivalent.

    - Final state Serializability may cause unrepeatable reads!

    - View Equivalence

    - Two schedules are view equivalent iff

    	- transaction X reads the initial value for S1, then also does S2

    	- transaction X reads a value written by transaction Y in S1, then also does S2

    	- transaction X writes final value written by transaction Y, then also does S2

    - View Serializabiility : there exists a serial schedule that is view equivalent to S

    - Verifiying view serializability is NP-hard

    - Conflict Equivalence

    	- Conflict: if one of two operations of different transactions in same opject is a write operation

    	- ex) Rx(A)Wy(A), \ Wx(A)Ry(A), \ Wx(A)Wy(A)

    	- swapping non-conflicting option을 통해 S1에서 S2 를 얻을 수 있다면 이는 conflict-equivalent이다.

    	- How to check conflict serializable : draw conflict graph and if there is no cycle, then conflict serializable

    	- How to draw conflict graph

    		- Draw nodes for each transactions

    		- check conflicting operation for each object

    		- draw an edge for each pair of conflicting option

    		- test if conflict graph has cycle

    	- Conflict Graph of transaction $R1(A)R2(A)R1(C)W1(A)R3(C)W2(B)W3(C)$

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
    1((1))
    2((2))
    3((3))
    2 -->|R2W1| 1
    1 --> |R1W3| 3
    2 --> |W2W3| 3

    ```

    - Equivalent serial schedule R2(A)W2(B)C2R1(A)R1(C)C1W3(B)W3(C)C3

    - Conflict graph of R1(A) R2(A) R1(C) W1(A) R1(D) W1(D)\\ C1 R3(C) W2(B) C2 W3(B) R3(D) W3(C) W3(D) C3

    ```mermaid
    flowchart BT
    1((1))
    2((2))
    3((3))
    1-->|R1W3C, W1W3D|3
    2-->|R2W1A|1
    2-->|W2W3B|3

    ```

    - Equivalent Serial Schedule R2(A) W2(B) C2 R1(A) R1(C) W1(A) R1 (D) W1(D) \\ C1 R3(C) W3(B) R3(D) W3(C) W3(D) C3

# MVCC

    - Lock-Based CC의 단점: read lock과 write lock은 각각 write, read/write을 제한하는데, overhead가 일어날 수 있다.

    - How to CC without changing the schedule? **Keep multiple version**

    - MVCC Protocol

    	- Each transaction receives STS when start

    	- Each writing transaction creates new version, and when commit, it has CTS and the value of object

    	- Version Filtering: latest version을 읽는데 이게 isolation level에 따라 다르다.

    - READ_COMMITTED의 경우, check latest version with CTS < TS(현재)를 기준으로 latest object를 읽는다.

    - REPEATABLE READ나 SERIALIZABLE의 경우, check latest version with CTS < STS = 1으로 트랜잭션별로 STS가 다르면 읽는 값이 달라질 것이다.

    - MVCC가 overhead를 해결하는 법

    	- original DB에 copy the latest version with CTS is less than minimum STS of running transactions.

    	- 즉 현재 실행중인 것들의 시작보다 빨리 커밋된 것 중 최신 거 제외하고 다 날려버림

    - Lost update 해결법: 만약 먼저 update, commit된 트랜잭션이 있다면, 다른 커밋하지 않은 트랜잭션은 abort된다.

# Logging and Recovery

    - Atomicity와 Durability를 보장하기 위한 장치임

    - RAM에 있는 Database는 컴퓨터를 끄면 날아가는데, 이를 disk로 넘기기 위한 장치이다. 하지만 RAM과 disk 사이에 속도 차이가 있어서 buffer에 저장하는 것

    - Logging Schemes

    	- Physical Logging: DB States(Before Image, After Image로 각각 변경 전후를 기록)

    	- Logical Logging: record the high-level operations by transactions, 즉 처음부터의 변경 사항을 다 저장함

    - Write-ahead logging: write all log entries of transaction before commit, buffer page before persisting

    - ARIES recovery algorithm: analysis, redo, undo를 통해 Atomicity와 Durability를 보장함

    - Redo: get back to state directly before crash

    - Undo: undo effects of aborted transactions
