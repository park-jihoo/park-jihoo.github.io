# Python Programming Basics

  - Types: Every value in python has particular type(int, float)

  - Call expressions: an expression that calls a function

  - Values do not have any meaning, so now we want to name them as **Variable**

  - You can create a new variable by naming and assigning it a value

  - String type is a type to represent text values

  - Type **bool** has only two values True or False

  - Class: another type of **object** that has variables and functions similar to module

  - Object Oriented Programming

  	- Encapsulation: Contain related information in an object

  	- Abstraction: Expose only high level interfaces to the outside world

  	- Inheritance: Child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class

  	- Polymorphism: A single method acts in a different way depending on objects

# Recursion, Search and Sorting algorithms

  ## Search

  	### Linear Search

  		- Search from the first item to the last item sequentially

  			```python
  			def linear_search(L, value):
  				for i in range(len(L)):
  					if L[i] == value:
  						return i
  				return -1
  			```

  		- Time complexity: Linearly Increasing

  	### Binary Search

  		- One evaluation removes **half** of candidate entries

  			```python
  			def binary_search(L, v):
  				start, end = 0, len(L)-1
  				while start != end + 1:
  					mid = (start + end) // 2
  					if L[mid] < v:
  						start = mid + 1
  					else:
  						end = mid - 1
  				if start < len(L) and L[start] == v:
  					return start
  				else:
  					return -1
  			```

  		- Time complexity: proportional to log 2

  ## Sort

  	### Selection Sort

  		- Find the minimum value of the unsorted list and swap it with the leftmost entry

  			```python
  			def selection_sort(L):
  				for i in range(len(L)):
  					smallest = i
  						for j in range(i+1, len(L)):
  							if L[j]<L[smallest]:
  								smallest = j
  					L[i], L[smallest] = L[smallest], L[i]
  			```

  		- Time complexity O(n^2)

  	### Insertion Sort

  		- Insert the leftmost item of the unsorted list to the proper location of the sorted list

  		- Time complexity O(n^2)
